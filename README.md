<h1 align="center">Jonas Design System</h1>

This is a sandbox project for testing different aspects of building a design system.

The project will consist of different packages to distribute only what the developer needs.

The project uses [lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) for publishing multiple packages from the main repository. The packages can be found [here](/packages/).
